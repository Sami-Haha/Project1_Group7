Project proposal draft
The aim of our project is to uncover patterns in electric vehicle ownership in Australia. Weâ€™ll examine relationships between vehicle ownership and location, vehicle ownership over a three year period and other relationships that can be derived from the data.
Summary
In this repository, Australian ownership data of each vehicle type is assessed against the corresponding postcode to gain an understanding of current trends of each vehicle type. It then focuses on electric vehicles, investigating the geographic impact on the number of electric vehicle registration, and what a typical person's demographic is that owns an electric vehicle.
